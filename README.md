=======

Sprocket is an Android audiobook player for Plex Media Server with Google Cast support. Simply simply login to access your audiobook libraries. Works better if you set the library agent to audiobook https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-audiobook-metadata-agent-audible/199579.

Make sure to set store track progress in Plex library settings.

Forked from Klingar by simonnorberg (https://github.com/simonnorberg/klingar)

Currently supports 
* Save book progress 
* Playback speed control. 
* Local Playback
* Cast Playback
* Android Auto support
* Android Wear support (I don't have a watch to test but should be working)

In the future

(Currently very heavily reliant on a connection to Plex)
